Limmuds are all about sharing, and accessibility and community building and encouragement.'),(22,1,1,15,'I am excited by a combination of the excitement and dynamism of youth group activities from my teenage years, combined with post-college adult learning which inspires intellectual curiosity and community building.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, I attended Limmud ATL+SouthEast, which reminded me of the joys of youth group, but for all ages. When I expressed an interest in bringing a Limmud to New England, I was invited to Limmud UK for their week-long event, returning on January 1, 2009. There I met mentors and learned more about the welcoming and inclusive, volunteer-driven Limmud International Values and Principles.\r\n\r\nLimmud UK is well-known in this area. Everyone with whom I chatted about bringing a Limmud to New England was enthusiastic about the concept. From academics to community organizers, organizational directors to educators, the concept was enthusiastically received. \r\n\r\n	We held our first Limmud in October 2010. The conference now takes place in early December. We rent out an entire synagogue building and hold 10-12 sessions in every classroom, nook and cranny, all day long.\r\n\r\n	In 1990-96, I created and ran a Jewish children’s book company called “Tree of Life Book Club,” which was designed to encourage Jewish literacy for families throughout the US & Canada. It was a pre-Amazon attempt at integrating books by topic. At that time, I was also on the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) Commission for Religious Living, and on the National Jewish Book Council.\r\n\r\nI started LimmudBoston with $250 and a free 10-user license for Salesforce.com. Using social media (mostly Facebook and Twitter) and free email program linked to our Salesforce account, we have built a mailing list of 3000 people. \r\nIn 2013 I was awarded the Synagogue Council of Massachusetts Clal Yisrael award for uniting the Jewish community through educational opportunities.\r\n\r\nEveryone comes as a learner to Limmud conferences, and everyone shares in the ownership of the event. Everyone pays to attend Limmud, yet no one is turned away. After registering, everyone helps out either by volunteering during the day or before the conference. Thus, everyone feels a part of the concept.'),(23,1,1,10,'Each year on the first Sunday after Thanksgiving weekend (first weekend in Dec.), we offer a conference where there are 10-12 choices each hour of courses, performances, panel discussions, demonstrations (food/crafts, etc.) We are now planning for our 8th annual event.\r\n\r\nOver 4-6 months, April-ish through October, our Program Team evaluates more than 100 session proposals down to over 85 sessions. The Music Team plans a concert for Saturday night as well both lunchtime and closing concerts. The Shabbat (Sabbath) team helps place speakers in area synagogues for the Friday and Saturday before the conference. The Sight and Signage team decorates the building that we rent. The Logistics Team arranges with local police for parking and anticipates any traffic issues. The office (in the home of the founder, sells and coordinates the annual (paper) program book with advertising, endorsement letters and a printed program book, as well as organizing a silent auction and selling sponsorship opportunities (\"Friends of LimmudBoston\").\r\n\r\nBeyond conference planning, we sponsor or co-sponsor learning opportunities throughout the year--often with one of our organizational sponsors, or with an area congregation or in conjunction with a local educational organization (Hebrew College, local synagogue\'s adult learning initiative, etc.)'),(24,1,1,13,'LimmudBoston celebrates Jewish Jewish life and learning with an annual, day-long conference.'),(25,1,1,12,'LimmudBoston, one of 84 Limmuds throughout the world that are based on the successful UK model, celebrates lifelong learning and Jewish culture in an annual conference.
